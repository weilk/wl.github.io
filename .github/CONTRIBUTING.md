# Contributing

You can create a `resume.json` file and run `npm run serve` to view it in the browser.

Before contributing code, make sure it conforms to [`.editorconfig`](../.editorconfig).

To contribute a translation, just copy `i18n/en.json` and change the filename to the language code.

That is all.
